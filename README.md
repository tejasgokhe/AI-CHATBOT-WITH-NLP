##DESCRIPTION:-
This project is an AI-powered chatbot developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal of this chatbot is to understand the user's input (in natural human language) and respond accordingly, just like a real conversation.

What It Does:
Accepts user input in plain English.
Uses NLP techniques to process and understand the input.
Identifies the intent behind the user's message.
Returns an appropriate response based on predefined patterns or logic.

Technologies & Libraries Used:
Python – For core programming.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) – For tokenization, lowercasing, and basic text preprocessing.
Custom logic – For matching user input to a list of known responses/intents.

NLP Concepts Used:
Tokenization – Breaking the user's sentence into words.
Lowercasing – Converting text to lowercase for uniformity.
Intent matching – Comparing the processed user input to known patterns.

Key Features:
Basic understanding of user input.
Customizable intents and responses.
Easy to expand or upgrade using more advanced NLP techniques (like Machine Learning or neural networks).

Platform Used:- Visual Studio Code.
